## Install

This is an early release, so currently you must [install the rust toolchain first][rustup]. Then restart your shell and run the following:

```sh
cargo install glint
```

Assuming ~/.cargo/bin is in your PATH (which the installer does by default), you should be able to run `glint` and get usage information.

## Usage
